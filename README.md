# ld64.lld

This repo vendors universal macOS binaries of [lld](https://lld.llvm.org) built for MachO support. Ideally these binaries will eventually come from [llvm releases](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) instead, but currently this project is in active development, and tracking a version closer to HEAD can be useful.
